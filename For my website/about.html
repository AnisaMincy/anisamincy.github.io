          <p>I began coding because my mom told me that it was something I should try and learn. We had done a little bit of it at school, but I wasn't too interested then. Only when I decided to give it another try did I realize how cool coding was. The first language I learned was python and it super easy and fun. I then got to go to a camp where I learned more coding and that's when I realized that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life. When I came back home I was determined to learn more Python, Javascript, and HTML. Using those skills I was able to build this site in one day!</p>
          <p>
            Coding is fun, easy, and it is something everyone is able to do. I started this website to teach other people to code because I believe whether you are going into the IT field or not coding is a useful skill to have. Just knowing the basics of a coding language is enough to make cool projects and have fun!
